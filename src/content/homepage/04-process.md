  - title: "Discovery + strategy"
    description: "First, we figure out what your site needs to accomplish. Who's using it? What are they looking for? What makes them hit that contact button? We ask the right questions so we can build you a site that works harder than your last three employees combined."
  - title: "Design"
    description: "This is where strategy takes visual form. Beautiful and functional, every detail is dialed in. One look and your customers know you're legit."
  - title: "Build"
    description: "Whether you need a full custom build or something we can launch next week, we match the approach to fit your needs. You get a site that loads fast, runs smoothly, and is built for the long run."
  - title: "Launch & support"
    description: "Your site goes live polished, tested, and ready to handle whatever the internet throws at it. We've checked everything twice because launching broken stuff keeps us up at night. After that, you decide: we stick around for the maintenance and updates, or we hand you the keys and you're off."
