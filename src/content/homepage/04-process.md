  - title: "Discovery + strategy"
    description: "Quick kickoff to confirm your goals and what you need the site to do. For straightforward projects, this is a 30-minute call. For complex builds, we go deeper with strategy and research. Either way, we make sure we're building the right thing."
  - title: "Design"
    description: "This is where strategy takes visual form. Beautiful and functional, every detail is dialed in. One look and your customers know you're legit."
  - title: "Build"
    description: "Whether you need a full custom build or something we can launch next week, we match the approach to fit your needs. You get a site that loads fast, runs smoothly, and is built for the long run."
  - title: "Launch & support"
    description: "Your site goes live polished, tested, and ready to handle whatever the internet throws at it. We've checked everything twice because launching broken stuff keeps us up at night. After that, you decide: we stick around for the maintenance and updates, or we hand you the keys and you're off."
