intro: "Not every business needs a six-week custom build. Sometimes you just need a clean, professional site that gets the job done and gets it done fast."

## What you get

You get a site built on a proven design, loaded with your content, your branding, and everything that makes your business yours. No fumbling through a website builder at midnight. No wondering if it looks "right." It looks right. We made sure.

## How it works

You tell us about your business and send us your content. We build something great, you say "hell yes," we launch it. And the whole way through, you'll know exactly where things stand.

## Two ways to pay

<div class="payment-options">
  <div class="payment-card">
    <h3>Pay upfront</h3>
    <p>One payment, the site is yours. If you want us to handle updates and keep things running after launch, we can do that too for a simple monthly fee.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="payment-card">
    <h3>Pay monthly</h3>
    <p>Skip the upfront cost entirely and pay a flat monthly rate that covers your site, hosting, and ongoing support. Same site, same quality, easier on your cash flow.</p>
  </div>
