title: "Demi: AI Software for Food Businesses"
order: 1
challenge: "A SaaS startup needed to transform complex B2B software into something that felt approachable. They were selling to food operators drowning in spreadsheets, but their product promised automation and AI. The challenge: make cutting-edge technology feel like relief, not another learning curve."
approach: "Food operators don't care about AI. They care about Friday afternoon when they're manually building prep lists for the third time that week. We built the messaging around those moments of frustration, not the technology solving them. The discovery process revealed that \"kitchen management software\" sounds like homework, but \"software built for how kitchens really run\" sounds like someone finally gets it."
solution: "Copy and custom images working together to translate complex platform functionality into something instantly clear. The strategy: speak to the pain points first, then show how the solution works using plain language and simplified visuals that make data-heavy concepts scannable."
results: "A marketing site that positions Demi as the tool that understands food operators. Clear messaging focused on solving real problems."
tech: "Framer"
