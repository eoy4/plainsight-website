challenge: "A food production company offering catering, vending, and private label services needed one site that served three very different audiences: office managers ordering catering, retailers looking for wholesale partnerships, and facility operators exploring vending solutions. Each audience has different priorities, different questions, and different decision-making processes."
approach: "Clear entry points based on what you're trying to solve. Discovery revealed that all three audiences shared one concern: reliability at scale. That became the unifying message underneath each offering."
solution: "Each section speaks directly to one audience's needs while maintaining a unified brand. The in-house printing capability became a differentiator across all three channels. Large, appetizing food photography that draws the user in and drives conversion."
results: "A single site that successfully converts three distinct audiences. Positioned UpMeals as a technology-enabled food partner with the scale and capability to deliver."
tech: "Framer"
