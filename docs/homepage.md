# Problem

## Header: Here's the thing about getting a website

Most small businesses know they need a website, but the process feels overwhelming. Too many options, too many cookie-cutter solutions that slap a template on every business like they're all the same. What's missing is strategy: understanding what your site needs to *achieve*. More customers? More bookings? Better leads? If your website isn't driving those results, it's just expensive decoration.

# How we’re different

## Heading: We’ll help you see the way forward

### It starts with strategy

We understand your business, your customers, and what success actually looks like before we write a single line of code.

### We've been doing this a long time

We bring decades of experience building everything from quick launches to complex custom builds. We've built enough sites to know exactly what yours needs. And what it doesn't.

### Quality work, quick turnarounds

We move fast without cutting corners. You get a site that's built right, looks sharp, and ready to pull its weight from day one.

### A process you'll actually enjoy

We turn that overwhelming feeling into clarity, then clarity into excitement. You'll know exactly what's happening, why we're doing it, and where things are headed. By the end, you'll have a website you're genuinely excited to show people.

# How we work

## Heading: From idea to launch

### Discovery + strategy

First, we figure out what your site actually needs to do. Who's using it? What are they looking for? What makes them hit that contact button? We ask the right questions so we can build you a site that works harder than your last three employees combined.

### Design

This is where strategy turns into something beautiful that actually works. Every choice serves a purpose, every detail is dialed in.  One look and your customers know you're legit.

### Build

Whether you need a full custom build or something we can launch next week, we match the approach to fit your needs. You get a site that loads fast, runs smoothly, and handles whatever you throw at it without breaking a sweat.

### Launch & support

Your site goes live polished, tested, and ready to handle whatever the internet throws at it.  We've checked everything twice because launching broken stuff keeps us up at night.  After that, you decide: we stick around for the maintenance and updates, or we hand you the keys and you're off.
