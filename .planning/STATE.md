# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** The hero headline must feel massive, confident, and impossible to ignore — dominating the viewport with sheer typographic scale.

**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Font Loading Optimization

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 3 (Font Loading Optimization)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase execution complete
Last activity: 2026-02-11 — Plan 02-01 executed (font preload optimization)

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~15 min
- Total execution time: ~0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1     | 1/1   | ~30m  | ~30m     |
| 2     | 1/1   | ~1m   | ~1m      |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~30m), 02-01 (~1m)
- Trend: Decreasing (optimization phase is simpler than foundation)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Headline max size refined to 8rem (128px) from original 9rem to prevent orphaned words
- Line-height set to 0.85 for tighter headline feel at large scale
- Vertical positioning changed from bottom-aligned to centered per user preference
- CTA label changed from "Let's talk" to "Explore what's possible"
- Tagline max capped at 2rem (32px) — original 3rem (48px) was too large
- [Phase 02]: Preload only hero font (Darker Grotesque), not body font (Manrope) - body text below fold is not CLS-critical
- [Phase 02]: Keep Google Fonts CDN during exploration phase for easy font swapping
