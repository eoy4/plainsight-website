# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** The hero headline must feel massive, confident, and impossible to ignore — dominating the viewport with sheer typographic scale and a living, animated background.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Pure CSS aurora (no React)**: Aurora component has zero interactivity; saves ~40KB React runtime
- **Replace glow, keep grid**: Aurora replaces radial glow; grid pattern adds texture on top
- **Theme-matched aurora colors**: Aurora adapts to warm (light) / teal-lime (dark) palettes

### Pending Todos
