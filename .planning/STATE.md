# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** The hero headline must feel massive, confident, and impossible to ignore — dominating the viewport with sheer typographic scale.

**Current focus:** Milestone complete — all 3 phases executed

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Visual Effects & Section Polish)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase execution complete
Last activity: 2026-02-11 — Phase 3 complete (scroll animations + typography hierarchy)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Total execution time: ~1 hour

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1     | 1/1   | ~30m  | ~30m     |
| 2     | 1/1   | ~1m   | ~1m      |
| 3     | 2/2   | ~15m  | ~7.5m    |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Headline max size refined to 8rem (128px) from original 9rem to prevent orphaned words
- Line-height set to 0.85 for tighter headline feel at large scale
- Vertical positioning changed from bottom-aligned to centered per user preference
- CTA label changed from "Let's talk" to "Explore what's possible"
- Tagline max capped at 2rem (32px) — original 3rem (48px) was too large
- [Phase 02]: Preload only hero font (Darker Grotesque), not body font (Manrope)
- [Phase 02]: Keep Google Fonts CDN during exploration phase for easy font swapping
- [Phase 03]: Section titles use font-extrabold (800) per user preference
- [Phase 03]: Expanded typography scaling to all content text, not just heading tokens

### Pending Todos
