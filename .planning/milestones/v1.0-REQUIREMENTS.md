# Requirements: Front Page Bold Redesign

**Defined:** 2026-02-10
**Core Value:** The hero headline must feel massive, confident, and impossible to ignore — dominating the viewport with sheer typographic scale.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Typography

- [x] **TYPO-01**: Hero headline uses viewport-filling fluid typography via `clamp()` with vw + rem bounds — delivered at clamp(3rem, 10vw, 8rem)
- [x] **TYPO-02**: Hero headline remains accessible — rem bounds in clamp enable user zoom per WCAG 1.4.4
- [x] **TYPO-03**: Hero headline scales responsively from mobile to ultra-wide without breaking
- [x] **TYPO-04**: Darker Grotesque switched to variable font (single file, weight 300-900) — via Google Fonts CDN

### Layout

- [x] **LAYO-01**: Hero text container expanded to clamp(900px, 80vw, 1400px)
- [x] **LAYO-02**: Hero uses `svh` viewport units instead of `vh` for correct mobile height
- [x] **LAYO-03**: Tagline and CTA are clearly secondary to the massive headline (visual hierarchy)
- [x] **LAYO-04**: Hero layout uses vertically centered composition (adjusted from off-center per user feedback)

### Effects

- [x] **EFCT-01**: Existing gradient text treatment and glow background preserved with @supports fallback
- [x] **EFCT-02**: Scroll-driven animations added to 6 below-fold sections with Intersection Observer fallback
- [x] **EFCT-03**: All homepage sections' typography hierarchy scaled to feel cohesive with bolder hero

### Performance

- [x] **PERF-01**: Hero display font preloaded to prevent layout shift during load

## v2 Requirements

### Typography

- **TYPO-05**: Variable font weight animation on hover/scroll for dynamic feel

### Effects

- **EFCT-04**: Layered depth effects in hero section

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Other pages redesign | Front page only — services, work, contact, blog unchanged |
| New sections or content restructuring | Existing section layout stays the same |
| Content changes | Same headline, tagline, CTA text from CMS |
| CLS optimization target | Font preloading covers the main risk; full CLS audit deferred |
| Component extraction (Hero.astro) | Architecture improvement but not a user-facing requirement |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| TYPO-01 | Phase 1 | ✅ Complete |
| TYPO-02 | Phase 1 | ✅ Complete |

| TYPO-04 | Phase 2 | ✅ Complete |
| LAYO-01 | Phase 1 | ✅ Complete |
| LAYO-02 | Phase 1 | ✅ Complete |
| LAYO-03 | Phase 1 | ✅ Complete |
| LAYO-04 | Phase 1 | ✅ Complete (adjusted to centered) |
| EFCT-01 | Phase 3 | ✅ Complete |
| EFCT-02 | Phase 3 | ✅ Complete |
| EFCT-03 | Phase 3 | ✅ Complete |
| PERF-01 | Phase 2 | ✅ Complete |
